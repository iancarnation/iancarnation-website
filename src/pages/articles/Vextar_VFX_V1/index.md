I've had fun setting up a few visual effects for Vextar. Please enjoy a tour through our current selection!


## Powerups
Powerups spawn in key points of a map and grant your disks deadly abilities.

### Freeze
This powerup gives your disks some homing ability and will slow down and obscure the view of your opponent.
Here's what you gotta grab:   
<div>
<video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="./freeze_10-13_02-640.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
</div>

<div>
<video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="./frozegnette_640.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
</div>
<br/>
<br/>

### Power
This powerup grants "insta-kill" abilities to your disks, taking your opponent out on the spot.   
<div>
<video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="./powerup_power_640.mp4" type="video/mp4">
