VextarMapMaker is a tool I'm working on for easing the pain of building levels in [Vextar](/projects/Vextar/), our multiplayer action game. The maps involve a series of platforms that you traverse as you engage in a deadly disc battle. Each platform has a number of 'launchers' on it that will launch you towards a corresponding platform. The process of setting up the launchers with the appropriate target and required velocity is currently quite tedious and time-consuming, so the main goal is to be able to quickly block out a set of platforms, map their connections, and automagically generate launchers with their appropriate velocity data. 

I thought it would be fun to make this a web app that anyone could visit and create a map that will be available in the game, perhaps hosting a gallery of other's creations that could be shared amongst the players of our game.

Feel free to visit the site, and see what state the VextarMapMaker is in!
