*Deadly disc  battles between cyborg clones in space over a black hole in the year 3020, the strange sport of the distant future!*

Vextar is a fast-paced multiplayer action game made in Unreal Engine 4. As our Technical Artist and Audio Designer, my main contributions so far have been designing our visual and sound effects, while near-future plans include a rigging and animation overhaul and building a map-making tool for use internally and by players of the game.
